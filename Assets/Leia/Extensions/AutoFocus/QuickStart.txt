	Leia Auto Focus Add-ons

	Description:
  	Provides functionality for automatically adjusting the LeiaDisplay's Focal Distance and Depth Factor.

	Quick start:
  1) Attach LeiaDepthFocus.cs to a GameObject with a LeiaDisplay component.

  2) (Optional) Adjust depth scale to increase or decrease the amount of depth output.

  3) (Optional) Adjust min and max baseline to set minimum and maximum possible baseline values for the LeiaCamera.

  LeiaDepthFocus may not work in some projects with shaders that don't write to the depth buffer. 
  Two alternative auto focus methods are provided; LeiaRaycastFocus, and LeiaTargetFocus.
  To learn more about these alternatives, see the documentation here:
